### Project Description
  The general idea of our issue reporting website is to allow users to report problems that they see around the Stevens community, and then the administrator can address the issues accordingly. The users must login with a registered account first before he/she can view, create, modify or delete an issue post. We will have separate issue boards in order to classify the same, such as: Housing, Maintenance, Tuition etc. <br />
  Registered users will not only be able to preview the posts’ details (description and comments) but also comment on the posts. Additionally, all the posts can be sorted by things such as date or type and users will be able to search for certain posts by providing the keyword. We would also utilize the foul language detection technology to try to screen out any harmful content that might have been posted (in the issue post’s details and comments). <br />
  Lastly, we would have an administrator panel that would have the clearance to delete or change the state of any issue post. The administrator can also create a new issue board or delete an existing one.
